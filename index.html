      I'm naman12, a mysterious user on <a href="https://aops.com">the Art of Problem Solving Community</a>. I feel that the community there has helped me, so in turn, I am trying to work to the benefit of this community. I'm interested in:
      <ul>
        <li> Math! One of my most time consuming activities. </li>
        <li> Science! Our team was pretty good at Science Olympiad. I hope to join Science Bowl next year! Specifically, I'm more of a physicist/chemist (and absolutely abhor biology).</li>
        <li> Quiz Bowl! Math and Science do help me here. I credit most of my (zero) success to being able to answer math and science questions on the fly.</li>
        <li> Business/Economics! I'm pretty interested in this, as it involves a lot of math. It's probably one of the most common uses of math in the real world.</li>
        <li> Computer Science! Oh, coding. I love coding. I set up this entire website myself by coding. I hope that someday you'll appreciate it too!</li>
      </ul>
      My handouts that I have made can be found <a href="handouts">here</a>. A lot of them are in collaboration with freeman66.<br /><br />
      If you have agreed on collaborating with me, please go to <a href="collaborators">this webpage</a> and enter the given password. Otherwise, if you would like to collaborate, please shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:realnaman12@gmail.com">realnaman12@gmail.com</a> with subject line <b>Collaborator!</b>
